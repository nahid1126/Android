# Android-Splash-Screen-Implementation

Almost every App shows a Splash screen at first of the App. Most of the tutorials and blogs says us to implement the splash screen in worst way. After passing some times on Android development I found three ways to implement a Splash Screen. You'll find them in this repository.

### [1. Android Splash screen in worst way](https://github.com/hasancse91/Android-Splash-Screen-Implementation/tree/master/01.%20Splash%20Screen%20in%20Worst%20Way)
* This way is simple to implement
* Not good for App performance
* Not good for User Experience
* Weird white/black screen after launching app and before showing splash screen (check screenshot)
